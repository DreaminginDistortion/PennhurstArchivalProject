                <h2>The Buildings of Pennhurst</h2>

                <p>The Pennhurst campus sprawled across 1,400 acres along the Schuylkill River, with buildings constructed in several stages between 1903 and the 1960s.<sup><a href="#cite1" aria-label="Citation 1">[1]</a></sup> Each structure served a specific function in the institution's attempt at self-sufficiency, though many would become sites of profound suffering. The older buildings, designed by architect Philip H. Johnson, were two-storied structures made of red brick, terra cotta, and granite trimmings, connected by fireproof underground tunnels with walkways—called catwalks—on top for transporting residents.<sup><a href="#cite2" aria-label="Citation 2">[2]</a></sup></p>

                    <strong>Engineering Marvel, Scene of Tragedy:</strong> An extensive network of fireproof concrete tunnels ran beneath the campus, connecting buildings above and below ground.<sup><a href="#cite2">[2]</a></sup> During winter, patients, food, supplies, and even bodies were transported through these tunnels. Walkways called "catwalks" ran on top of the tunnels for additional transportation routes. Steam pipes distributed heat throughout the connected buildings. Visitors decades after closure report an oppressive atmosphere in these passages, and teeth from extracted dental procedures were found in the tunnels years after the institution closed.<sup><a href="#cite10">[10]</a></sup>
                </div>

                <h3>Campus Layout and Preservation</h3>

                <p>The Pennhurst campus was divided into upper and lower sections stretching along the Schuylkill River. The road pattern, including the traffic circle adjacent to Tinicum and Mayflower Halls, remains unchanged from Victorian times.<sup><a href="#cite9">[9]</a></sup> Much of the property is surrounded by a carefully laid and pointed stone wall, with the longest expanse—nearly entirely intact—running along Commonwealth Drive. The wall incorporates elaborate gates at various access points, and six grand entrance pillars of similar design still stand.<sup><a href="#cite9">[9]</a></sup></p>

                <p>The upper campus was acquired by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and renovated as the Southeastern Veterans' Center, which opened in 1986.<sup><a href="#cite18">[18]</a></sup> The lower campus buildings, many now in severe disrepair, remain as haunting reminders of institutional life. By 2020, several buildings including Hershey, Rockwell, and Dietary halls were deemed unsafe for reuse and demolished.<sup><a href="#cite8">[8]</a></sup></p>

                <div class="fact-box">
                    <strong>Preservation Efforts:</strong> Pennhurst was designated a historic property in 1972 under constitutional protection for historic properties.<sup><a href="#cite23">[23]</a></sup> In 2015, the Pennhurst Memorial and Preservation Alliance began working with the Southeastern Veterans' Center to obtain the superintendent's residence for a future museum and interpretive center.<sup><a href="#cite24">[24]</a></sup> The Alliance advocates for creating a proper memorial to honor those who lived and died at Pennhurst, opposing the commercialization of the site as a haunted attraction.</p>
