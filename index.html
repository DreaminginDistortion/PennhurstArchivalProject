                <h2>Historical Context</h2>
                
                <p>Pennhurst State School and Hospital was authorized by the Pennsylvania Legislature in 1903 and admitted its first resident on November 23, 1908. Originally named the Eastern Pennsylvania State Institution for the Feeble-Minded and Epileptic, the facility was part of a broader eugenics-driven movement to segregate individuals with disabilities from society.</p>

                <p>At its peak in 1955, Pennhurst housed over 3,500 residents in facilities designed for approximately 500, with chronic understaffing and inadequate resources. The institution operated for nearly 80 years until its court-ordered closure in 1987, following the landmark case Halderman v. Pennhurst that established constitutional protections for individuals with disabilities.</p>
